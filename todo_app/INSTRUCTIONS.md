# TODO Application

## Problem Statement

Make a small application that can be used as a simple todo list. You should be
able to add tasks, view tasks, delete tasks.

It needs to be a client server application Architecture. (XAMP Stack) In
addition to the code you need the following as well.

| Requirements                               | Number                              |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Functional requirements (required/desired) | 3                                   |
| Non-functional requirements                | 3                                   |
| System Architecture Diagram                | 1 for the complete system           |
| Data Flow Diagram                          | 1 for the complete system (level 2) |
| Use case                                   | 3 use cases                         |
| Sequence Diagram                           | 3 sequence diagrams                 |
| Database Design                            | 1 for the system, 3 tables          |
| Class diagram                              | 1 for the system, 3 classes         |
| Test Case                                  | 3 operations to be tested           |

## FAQ

1. This is supposed to be a web site. Showing adding/removing/listing entries in
   a command line or a database editor is not sufficient. The UI should be
   runnable in a browser.
2. XAMPP is fine. We mainly want the database to be MySql (or the MariaDB fork)
   and the server language to be PHP.
3. You do not need to host this publically. Running it locally is sufficient.
4. Part of this exercise is to practice you software engineering skills. As
   such, if some of your diagrams are overly simplistic, we understand. If you'd
   like to get some more practice, hypothesize some more features (delete undo,
   multiple users, login, etc) and build your documentation to support those
   features in addition to the required ones.
